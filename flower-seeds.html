    <h1>Annuals</h1>
    <p>Life Cycle: Annual plants complete their entire life cycle—from germination to seed production to death—within a single growing season, which typically lasts one year.</p>
        <p>Growth Period: They sprout, grow, bloom, produce seeds, and die all in one year.</p>
        <p>Replanting: Annuals need to be replanted every year if you want them to grow again.</p>
        <p>Examples: Common examples of annuals include marigolds, petunias, zinnias, and most vegetable crops like tomatoes, beans, and lettuce.</p>

    <h1>Perinnials</h1>
    <p>Life Cycle: Perennial plants live for more than two years. They go through repeated cycles of growth and blooming year after year.</p>
    <p>Growth Period: After the initial planting, perennials will grow and bloom each season and then die back to the ground level during the off-season (often winter), regrowing from their root systems in the following season.</p>
    <p>Replanting: Perennials do not need to be replanted every year. Once established, they can continue to grow and bloom for several years.</p>
    <p>Examples: Common examples of perennials include peonies, hostas, daylilies, and many types of shrubs and trees.</p>
